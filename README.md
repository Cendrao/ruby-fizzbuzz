Fizz Buzz with TDD
===


Trying to do some tests with ruby test!

To run the tests just do from root:

```
rake test
```


To see the methods running you can use print task, with from and to parameters to see the sequence

```
rake print[from, to]
```

Or fizzbuzz task, to see a single number

```
rake fizzbuzz[num]
```



Next Steps:
-----

* Make a FizzBuzz a beautifull class
* ~~Make rake for the tests~~
