[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/Cendrao/ruby-fizzbuzz/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/Cendrao/ruby-fizzbuzz?branch=master)


Trying to do some tests with ruby test!

First install dependencies

```
bundle install
```

To run the tests do:

```
bundle exec rake test
```


To see the methods running you can use print task, with from and to parameters to see the sequence

```
rake print[from, to]
```

Or fizzbuzz task, to see a single number

```
rake fizzbuzz[num]
```



Next Steps:
-----

* Make a FizzBuzz a beautifull class
* ~~Make rake for the tests~~
