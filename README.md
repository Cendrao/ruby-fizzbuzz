Fizz Buzz with TDD
===

There is no dependencies, so for while gemfile is empty
-------------------

Trying to do some tests with ruby test!

To run the tests just do from root:

```
ruby /test/fizzbuzz_test.rb
```

I will make the rakefile soon


Next Steps:

Make a FizzBuzz a beautifull class
